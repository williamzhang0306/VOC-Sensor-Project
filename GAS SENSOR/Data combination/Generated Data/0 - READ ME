The data in this folder is used to store Mixture objects

File name formatting:
The number that comes infront of a VOC name is the concentration of that VOC.
The last number in the name (which should not be attached to any VOC) is the heating ramp rate.
For example, 0.5Toulene_0.5IPA_1.5 is a mixture that is 50% Toulene and 50% IPA, and its ramp rate is 1.5 degrees C per second.


File formatting:
The first line contains all the names of the VOCs in the gas mixture
The second line contains their respective concentrationsq
The third line is the heating ramp rate
The following lines contain the time elapsed, the respective delta PID voltage readings for each VOC, and the PID voltage reading for the mixture

Example:

[0] Benzaldehyde Benzene Oxylene  # names
[1] 0.2 0.5 0.1                   # concentrations
[2] 0.5                           # ramp rate measured in degrees (celsius/second)
[3] 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0           # data, time elapsed is the first column, mixture reading is the final column. Columns in between
[4] 2.0 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.3           # are readings for the component gasses
[5] 4.0 0.1 0.2 0.2 0.5
[6] 6.0 0.1 0.1 0.4 0.6
